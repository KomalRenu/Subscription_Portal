Subscription Portal retrieves the definition of the stock symbol prompt from MicroStrategy Intelligence Server and shows that prompt to the user.  <li class="SmartList1" value="2"><a name="1081407"> </a>The user answers the prompt by selecting one or more stock symbols from the list.  <li class="SmartList1" value="3"><a name="1081408"> </a>Subscription Portal inserts one record into the REL_ANSWER_SYMBOL table for each stock that the user selects, as specified by the Portal Administrator Wizard alternate question mapping. Each record includes the Narrowcast Server User ID, the Subscription Portal-generated Answer ID, and the stock symbol.  <li class="SmartList1" value="4"><a name="1081409"> </a>Subscription Portal creates an entry in the Subscription Book Repository for the new subscription. The definition of this subscription contains a preference object that is associated with Example 3 Page-by Information Object. The value of the preference object is the Answer ID that was written to the warehouse, since "Answer to another question" was specified as the page-by answer for this question on the Portal Administrator Wizard Services Configuration page. Subscription Portal also stores the user's answer to the prompt in the Subscription Book Repository, as a preference object that is associated with the Example 3 Alternate Question Object.  <li class="SmartList1" value="5"><a name="1081410"> </a>When Narrowcast Server runs the service, it first retrieves a list of subscriptions to this service from the Subscription Book Repository. For each subscription, Narrowcast Server retrieves the value of the preference object that corresponds to Example 3 Page-by Information Object, also from the Subscription Book Repository. Narrowcast Server then executes the report associated with the content information object just once. The results of this report contain data for all of the preferences that were written to the REL_ANSWER_SYMBOL table. Narrowcast Server uses the value of the preference object for each subscription, which in this case is the Answer ID that was written to the warehouse, as the page-by value to personalize the content of the information object. Each page of data includes those stocks that correspond to the user's selections for the subscription.</ol>  </body></html>
