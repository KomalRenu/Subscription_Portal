Subscription Portal retrieves the definition of the value prompt from MicroStrategy Intelligence Server and shows that prompt to the user (the threshold prompt).  <li class="SmartList1" value="2"><a name="1081262"> </a>The user answers the prompt by entering a numeric value.  <li class="SmartList1" value="3"><a name="1081263"> </a>Subscription Portal inserts a single record into the SUB_THRESHOLD table in the warehouse, as specified by the Portal Administrator Wizard alternate question mapping. This record includes the Narrowcast Server User ID, the Subscription Portal-generated Subscription ID, and the numeric value the user entered.  <li class="SmartList1" value="4"><a name="1081264"> </a> Subscription Portal creates an entry in the Subscription Book Repository for the new subscription. The definition of this subscription contains a preference object that is associated with <strong class="Strong">Example 2 Page-by Information Object</strong>. The value of the preference object is the Subscription ID, since that is what was specified as the page-by answer for this question on the Portal Administrator Wizard Services Configuration page. Subscription Portal also stores the user's answer to the prompt in the Subscription Book Repository, as a preference object that is associated with the <strong class="Strong">Example 2 Alternate Question Object</strong>.  <li class="SmartList1" value="5"><a name="1081265"> </a>When Narrowcast Server runs the service, it first retrieves a list of subscriptions to this service from the Subscription Book Repository. For each subscription, Narrowcast Server retrieves the value of the preference object that corresponds to <strong class="Strong">Example 2 Page-by Information Object</strong>, also from the Subscription Book Repository. Narrowcast Server then executes the report associated with the content information object just once. The results of this report contain data for all of the subscriptions that were written to the SUB_THRESHOLD. Narrowcast Server uses the value of the preference object for each subscription, which in this case is the Subscription ID, as the page-by value to personalize the content of the information object. Each page of data includes only those stocks that meet the condition determined by the subscription's threshold value.</ol>  </body></html>
