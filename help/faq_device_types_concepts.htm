Narrowcast Server can deliver content to a large variety of devices, and each service is designed to deliver content to some subset of these devices such as desktop e-mail clients or wireless devices. Thus, when users create addresses and subscribe to services via the Subscription Portal, they must be allowed to select devices that are supported by the services to which they are subscribing. This is controlled by the Portal Administrator using <strong>device types</strong>.</p><p class="Body">  <a name="1064859"> </a>A </a>device type is a grouping of devices defined in a Subscription Portal to make it easier for a user to find a certain device. For example, all e-mail devices are in a grouping called E-mail. </p><p class="Body">  <a name="1065551"> </a>A device type is defined by selecting one or more <strong class="Strong">folders</strong> of devices from the </a>Object Repository. Each <strong class="Strong">service</strong> defined in the Object Repository supports a specific list of devices. You do not need to allow users to create addresses using devices that are not supported in any services in your Narrowcast Server system.</p><p class="Body">  <a name="1065539"> </a>The four device types that Narrowcast Server Subscription Portal defines by default are:</p><ul>  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="1064861"> </a>mobile phone   <li class="SmartList1"><a name="1064862"> </a>pager   <li class="SmartList1"><a name="1064863"> </a>e-mail   <li class="SmartList1"><a name="1065602"> </a>personal digital assistants</ul><p class="Body">  <a name="1065603"> </a>These device types simply organize the devices to be made available to your subscribers.</p><p class="Body">  <a name="1065621"> </a>If you do not plan to support any of the devices in a given device type, you can remove that type through the Portal Administrator Wizard. You can also define your own groupings of devices by creating a new device type definition.</p><h4 class="Heading3">  <a name="1069689"> </a>Device folders</h4><p class="Body">  <a name="1069693"> </a>Devices are created by the System Administrator in the Narrowcast Server Device Editor and stored in <strong class="Strong"></a>device folders</strong>. You can select groupings of devices and make them available to end users by selecting them through the Device Folders page in the Portal Administrator Wizard. </p><p class="Body">  <a name="1069760"> </a>The first time you access the Device Folders page it shows the four default device types. You can add additional folders to the available and selected tables by navigating through the folder structure.</p>  </body></html>
