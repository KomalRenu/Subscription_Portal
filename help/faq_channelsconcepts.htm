Channels are created through the <strong class="Strong"></a>Narrowcast Server Subscription Portal Administrator Wizard</strong> and deployed through the Subscription Portal.</p><p class="Body">  <a name="1067965"> </a>A channel is defined by a folder of services from an Object Repository. Multiple channels can be defined within one site to group different sets of services. Each channel appears as a tab in the Subscription Portal interface. Each user subscription that is created through the Subscription Portal can be accessed only through the channel through which it was created. A site without at least one channel does not provide any functionality to end users.</p><p class="Body">When a folder is selected in a Narrowcast Server system to define a channel, this selection provides the structure of the channel in terms of what services are available and how these services are arranged in subfolders within the Subscription Portal. Each subfolder under the folder chosen to define the channel appears as a folder in the Subscription Portal and services are arranged within these folders just as they are within Narrowcast Administrator. In other words, the folder structure and service location in Narrowcast Administrator completely controls how services are arranged and grouped within the Subscription Portal. Thus, application design in Narrowcast Administrator should be carefully considered to ensure that services are logically arranged into folders so that the channels and their structure appears as desired in the Subscription Portal.</p><p class="Body">  <a name="1065836"> </a>When a channel is created it is assigned a unique identification number. If a channel is deleted and then later recreated, it is assigned a different identification number in the Portal Repository database. One result of this is that end users cannot access, change, or delete services to which they have subscribed if the channel is deleted, or deleted and recreated.</p><p class="Body">  <a name="1069682"> </a>Publishing a channel consists of selecting a channel folder and entering a channel name and description.</p><h4 class="Heading3">  <a name="1065531"> </a>Channel folders</h4><p class="Body">  <a name="1065535"> </a><strong class="Strong">C</a>hannel folders</strong> are the means by which services are grouped. Services can be published at any level within the folder structure. End users navigate through the Subscription Portal and select channel folders containing the services to which they want to subscribe.</p><h4 class="Heading3">  <a name="1069478"> </a></a>Channel name and description</h4><p class="Body">  <a name="1069482"> </a>Once a folder is selected from the Object Repository, a channel <strong class="Strong">name</strong> and <strong class="Strong">description</strong> must be entered.
