The content of the service that the user receives includes detailed information about each of these stocks. While creating the subscription, the user should be able to save the list of stocks with a name, so that when creating other subscriptions to this or other services the user can select from any of those saved lists.</p><p class="Body">  <a name="1081285"> </a>The approach used in this example allows the Narrowcast Server application designer to use personalized page execution, and gives the user the option of choosing more than one attribute element as a preference object. (Scenario 1 limits the user to only a single attribute element per Information Object.) In this example, the subscriber can choose multiple symbols as his preference. Each symbol is written to a table in the warehouse that relates a Subscription Portal-generated Answer ID to the selected symbols. This same Answer ID is stored in the Subscription Book Repository as the preference object of the subscription, and the content information object will page by Answer ID. When the service is run, the user receives all the stock information related to the Answer ID of the subscription. </p><p class="Body">  <a name="1081286"> </a>You can choose this approach because you want to take advantage of the performance of personalized page execution (only execute one query against the warehouse). This requires the user's personalization to be stored in the warehouse. You might also want to have easy access to each subscriber's personalization values, which is only feasible when the personalization information is stored in the warehouse. In this case, you choose to page by Answer ID because that allows the personalization to be at the subscription level, while not requiring the content information object to return duplicate data in the case that the user subscribes to this service more than once using the same set of stocks (stored in a user preference), as would be the case if the page-by was by Subscription ID.</p><p class="Body">  <a name="1081287"> </a>This example assumes that your warehouse contains a populated table with a list of stock symbols and associated facts. The table is assumed to have the following columns:</p><p class="Body">  <a name="1070677"> </a><code class="Code">SYMBOL, LAST_TRADE_PRICE, and PCT_CHANGE</code></p><p class="Body">  <a name="1070678"> </a>(Suggested name: LU_SYMBOLS)</p><p class="Body">  <a name="1080692"> </a>For more information, see the following:</p><ul>  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="1080696"> </a><a href="bcapp_17.htm#1070705">Change the warehouse</a>  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="1080700"> </a><a href="bcapp_18.htm#1070710">Create objects in the MicroStrategy Desktop interface</a>  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="1080704"> </a><a href="bcapp_19.htm#1081338">Create objects in Narrowcast Administrator</a>  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="1080708"> </a><a href="bcapp_20.htm#1081347">Configure with the Portal Administrator Wizard</a>  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="1080712"> </a><a href="bcapp_21.htm#1070744">Try it!</a>  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="1080716"> </a><a href="bcapp_22.htm#1070753">How it works</a></ul>  </body></html>
