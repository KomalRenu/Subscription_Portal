This is useful for changing or alert-driven subscription sets. Some dynamic subscription sets acquire all their information from a single information object. Others retrieve only the subscription ID from the information object while the rest of the subscription information is acquired from the Subscription Book Repository. Still others combine both methods. </p><p class="Body">  <a name="1065322"> </a>The information is usually stored in a data warehouse which is a large database used to access a company's historical data stores. It is used for decision support within an organization, allowing for data organization and coordinated updates and loads. It can also refer to a copy of transaction data specifically structured for query, retrieval, and analysis.</p>  </body></html>
