The Subscription Engine is accessed through the interface of the Subscription Portal Web pages.</p><p class="Body">When you configure the Subscription Engine you need to provide two pieces of information:</p><ul><li>the name of the server running the Subscription Engine<li>the location of the Portal Repository</ul><strong>Subscription Engine server name</strong><p class="Body">During a typical installation the Subscription Engine is installed on the same machine as the Portal Administrator and Subscription Portal application. This machine is the <strong>localhost</strong>, unless you have chosen to install the Subscription Engine on a different machine.</p><p class="Body"><strong>Note:</strong> The Subscription Engine services should run automatically when the machine starts. If the Subscription Engine services do not start automatically, you must manually start the six components of theSubscription Engine. These are JDataServer, MicroStrategy Subscription Administrator, MicroStrategy Subscription Engine, MicroStrategy Subscription Logger, MicroStrategy Subscription Lookup, and MicroStrategy Subscription Server.
