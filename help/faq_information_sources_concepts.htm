When Narrowcast Server connects to an information source to obtain content information, it uses authentication credentials that are specific to the information source. For example, when connecting to a MicroStrategy project, Narrowcast Server needs a login ID and password for that project.</p><p class="Body">  <a name="1069862"> </a>Narrowcast Server allows each user account to specify its own authentication credentials for each information source. If an authentication is specified for a certain user, that authentication is used for all connections to the specified information on behalf of that user. The definition of each information source also includes a default authentication that is used for all connections of any users for which no user-level authentication has been specified.</p><p class="Body">  <a name="1069899"> </a>The Portal Administrator Wizard allows you to specify whether user accounts created through the Subscription Portal interface are allowed to enter their own authentication credentials for each information source, or if the default credentials for that information source will be used instead.</p><p class="Body">  <a name="1069910"> </a>For each information source, you can select from the following options:</p><ul>  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="1069915"> </a>Use Project Credentials  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="1069916"> </a>Use User Credentials (required)  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="1069917"> </a>Use User Credentials (optional)</ul><h4 class="Heading3">  <a name="1065721"> </a></a>Use Project Credentials</h4><p class="Body">  <a name="1064874"> </a>When a new user account is created through the Subscription Portal interface, the user is not prompted to enter authentication credentials for this information source.

If the user chooses to do so, the user name and password entered must be valid credentials for connecting to the information source. Alternatively, the user creating the account can choose to leave the user name and password blank, in which case the new account uses the default authentication credentials as specified in the definition of the information source.</p>  </body></html>
