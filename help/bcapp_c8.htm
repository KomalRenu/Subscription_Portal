Subscription Portal retrieves the definition of the attribute element prompt from MicroStrategy Intelligence Server and shows that prompt to the user.  <li class="SmartList1" value="2"><a name="1081156"> </a>The user answers the prompt by selecting a single attribute element.  <li class="SmartList1" value="3"><a name="1081157"> </a>Subscription Portal creates an entry in the Subscription Book Repository for the new subscription. The definition of this subscription contains a preference object that is associated with <strong class="Strong">Example 1 Page-by Information Object</strong>. The value of the preference object is the ID of the attribute element that the user selected, since "Answer to another question" was specified as the page-by answer for this question on the Portal Administrator Wizard Services Configuration page. Subscription Portal also stores the user's answer to the prompt in the Subscription Book Repository, as a preference object that is associated with the <strong class="Strong">Example 1 Alternate Question Object</strong>.  <li class="SmartList1" value="4"><a name="1081158"> </a>When Narrowcast Server runs the service, it first retrieves a list of subscriptions to this service from the Subscription Book Repository. For each subscription, Narrowcast Server retrieves the value of the preference object that corresponds to <strong class="Strong">Example 1 Page-by Information Object</strong>, also from the Subscription Book Repository. Narrowcast Server then executes the report associated with the content information object just once. The results of this report contain data for all of the elements of the page-by attribute. Narrowcast Server uses the value of the preference object for each subscription, which in this case is the ID of the page-by attribute element, as the page-by value to personalize the content of the information object. Each page of data includes only the data that corresponds to the selected attribute element.</ol>  </body></html>
