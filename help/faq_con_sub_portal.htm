These pages point to a virtual directory, or URL, that correspond to the appropriate file names.  When the end user accesses the virtual directory through the Web browser a set of properties called a site definition determines what the end user sees.</p><h2>Virtual Directory</h2><p>The virtual directory is the name assigned by the Portal Administrator to distinguish between subscription portals.  Each virtual directory refers to a unique set of pages stored on the Web server.  </p> </font></body></html>
