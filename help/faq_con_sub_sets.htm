This is useful when the set of end user addresses that should receive a service does not change. See also subscription set.</p><a name="dynamic"><h2>Dynamic Subscription Sets</h2></a><p>The dynamic subscription set contains at least one piece of subscription information retrieved from an information object instead of from the Subscription Book Repository. This is useful for changing or alert-driven subscription sets. Some dynamic subscription sets acquire all their information from a single information object. Others retrieve only the subscription ID from the information object while the rest of the subscription information is acquired from the Subscription Book Repository. Still others combine both methods. </p><p>The information is usually stored in a data warehouse which is a large database used to access a company’s historical data stores.  It is used for decision support within an organization, allowing for data organization  and  coordinated updates and loads.  It can also refer to a copy of transaction data specifically structured for query, retrieval, and analysis.</p><a name="pageby"><h2>Page-by Report Options</h2></a><p>In the context of a MicroStrategy information source, a means of breaking report results into separate pages and treating each individual page as a viewable result. </p><p>For configuring service offerings you need to select one of three options:</p><ul type="filledcircle"><li>Subscription_ID<li>User_ID<li>Address_ID</li></ul>If you are not configuring individual subscription sets, it is strongly recommended that you select <b>User_ID</b> as the default prior to proceeding.</p><a name="questionobj"><h2>Question Objects</h2></a><p>A question object is a type of information source object that specifies the questions to ask the user to determine the user’s preferences. The answers are used as preference objects. For a MicroStrategy information source, a question object is defined by choosing a report, and the questions that are asked depend on the definition of that report.</p><p>In personalized page execution mode, the question asked of the user is what page to return, using the page-by function. In personalized report execution mode, the questions include all prompt objects defined on the selected report except the security object prompt.</p></font></body></html>
