The user then receives a service whose content includes a list of stocks whose percent change was greater than that value.</p><p class="Body">  <a name="1081174"> </a>The approach used in this example allows the Narrowcast Server application designer to use personalized page execution and to store the subscriber's preference value in the warehouse. This value is not necessarily returned in the report but is used to calculate which data are returned. In this example, the subscriber chooses a stock alert threshold percentage. The report has a filter that returns only symbols whose percent change was greater than the threshold entered by the subscriber. The threshold values must be stored on the Subscription ID level and are more easily manipulated as metrics in the warehouse (rather than as preference objects in the Subscription Book Repository).</p><p class="Body">  <a name="1081175"> </a>You can choose this approach because you want to take advantage of the performance of personalized page execution (only execute one query against the warehouse). In this case, the user's personalization needs to be stored in the warehouse. You might also want to have easy access to each subscriber's personalization values, which is only feasible when the personalization information is stored in the warehouse. In this case, you choose to page by Subscription ID because that allows the personalization to be at the subscription level, but the threshold value is not reusable (that is, the User Preferences feature is disabled for this question in the Subscription Portal interface).</p><p class="Body">  <a name="1081176"> </a>This example assumes that your warehouse contains a populated table with a list of stock symbols and associated facts. The table is assumed to have the following columns:</p><p class="Body">  <a name="1070585"> </a><code class="Code">SYMBOL, LAST_TRADE_PRICE, and PCT_CHANGE</code></p><p class="Body">  <a name="1070586"> </a>(Suggested name: LU_SYMBOLS)</p><p class="Body">  <a name="1080663"> </a>For more information, see the following:</p><ul>  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="1080667"> </a><a href="bcapp_10.htm#1070613">Change the warehouse</a>  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="1080671"> </a><a href="bcapp_11.htm#1070618">Create objects in the MicroStrategy Desktop interface</a>  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="1080675"> </a><a href="bcapp_12.htm#1070632">Create objects in Narrowcast Administrator</a>  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="1080679"> </a><a href="bcapp_13.htm#1070642">Configure with the Portal Administrator Wizard</a>  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="1080683"> </a><a href="bcapp_14.htm#1070653">Try it!</a>  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="1080687"> </a><a href="bcapp_15.htm#1070662">How it works</a></ul>  </body></html>
