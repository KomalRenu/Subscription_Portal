Specifically, the service under which the Subscription Administrator service runs must have read and write access to either the folder where the Subscription Engine is installed or to the entire drive. MicroStrategy Narrowcast Server and MicroStrategy Web can automatically share this drive for the local Administrators group. Since the Subscription Administrator service should run under an account that is a member of the local Administrators group, this should resolve this problem in most cases. If you do not want to automatically share the drive, take the following actions to share the folder where the Subscription Engine is installed.</p><dt class="Note"><strong>Important: </strong>You must perform all three steps listed below. <ol>  <li class="SmartList1">Modify the Admin.properties file located in the <strong>..\Microstrategy\Narrowcast Server\Subscription Engine\build\server\</strong> folder on the Subscription Engine machine.  Modify the file contents such that the corresponding two lines appear as follows:<br><br><strong>TransactionEngineLocation=MACHINE_NAME:\\Subscription Engine\\build\\server</strong><br><strong>TransactionEngineLocation=MACHINE_NAME:/Subscription Engine/build/server</strong><br><br>where <strong>MACHINE_NAME</strong> is the name of the machine where the Subscription Engine is installed.<br><br><li class="SmartList1">Share the folder where the Subscription Engine is installed for either the local Administrators group or for the account under which the Subscription Administrator service account runs. This folder must be shared as Subscription Engine.<br><br><dt class="Note"><strong>Note: </strong>You should ensure that the password for this account will not expire. <p class="Body">If the Subscription Engine machine’s drive is shared and unshared multiple times, the following Windows message appears and waits for user input: System Error: The network name was deleted. The Subscription Administrator service is not functional until you click OK and dismiss this message. This message does not indicate a problem. You should simply click OK and continue.</p><li class="SmartList1">Restart the Subscription Administrator service.</ol>  </body></html>
