This record includes the Subscription Portal-generated Subscription ID, the ID of the address the user selected for this subscription, and the Narrowcast Server User ID.  <li class="SmartList1" value="4"><a name="1081512"> </a>When Narrowcast Server runs the service, it first retrieves a list of subscriptions to this service from the warehouse by executing <strong class="Strong">Example 4 Subscription Information Object</strong>. Narrowcast Server then executes the report associated with the content information object just once. Since this information object is not personalized, the same content is used for all subscriptions to this service. Finally, Narrowcast Server uses the Address ID from the subscription information object to look up the delivery address for each subscription in the Subscription Book Repository, as specified in the definition of <strong class="Strong">Example 4 Subscription Information Object</strong>.</ol>  </body></html>
