The user then receives a service whose content includes a list of stocks whose percent change was greater than that value.</p><p class="Body">  <a name="1081520"> </a>The approach used in this example allows the Narrowcast Server application designer to use personalized page execution and to store the subscriber's preference value in the warehouse. This value is not necessarily returned in the report but is used to calculate which data are returned. In this example, the subscriber chooses a stock alert threshold percentage. The report has a filter that returns only symbols whose percent change was greater than the threshold entered by the subscriber. The threshold values must be stored on the Subscription ID level and are more easily manipulated as metrics in the warehouse (rather than as preference objects in the Subscription Book Repository).</p><p class="Body">  <a name="1081521"> </a>This example illustrates a dynamic subscription set with subscription-level personalization. It requires both a question object storage mapping (for the threshold value) and a subscription set storage mapping. As in Scenario 4, you are writing subscriptions to the warehouse and retrieving them via a dynamic subscription set from the warehouse. The subscription information object returns Subscription IDs based on the threshold filtering conditions. To the user, this case is no different than Scenario 2 in terms of the process of signing up for the service. However, since this example uses a dynamic subscription set, Narrowcast Server retrieves the list of subscriptions from a warehouse report instead of from the Subscription Book Repository. </p><p class="Body">  <a name="1081522"> </a>You can choose this approach because you want to take advantage of the performance of personalized page execution (only execute one query against the warehouse). In this case, the user's personalization needs to be stored in the warehouse. You might also want to have easy access to each subscriber's personalization values, which is only feasible when the personalization information is stored in the warehouse. Finally, storing the subscription information in the warehouse has many advantages, such as the ability to manage, analyze, filter, or even populate and modify subscription information from sources other than Narrowcast Server. It also allows the Narrowcast Server system administrator a large amount of flexibility in determining the structure of the tables that hold the subscription information, which is not possible using static subscription sets.</p><p class="Body">  <a name="1070849"> </a>This example assumes that your warehouse contains a populated table with a list of stock symbols and associated facts. The table is assumed to have the following columns:</p><p class="Body">  <a name="1070854"> </a><code class="Code">SYMBOL, LAST_TRADE_PRICE, and PCT_CHANGE</code></p><p class="Body">  <a name="1070855"> </a>(Suggested name: LU_SYMBOLS)</p><p class="Body">  <a name="1080770"> </a>For more information, see the following:</p><ul>  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="1080774"> </a><a href="bcapp_31.htm#1070882">Change the warehouse</a>  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="1080778"> </a><a href="bcapp_32.htm#1070892">Create objects in the MicroStrategy Desktop interface</a>  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="1080782"> </a><a href="bcapp_33.htm#1070906">Create objects in Narrowcast Administrator</a>  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="1080786"> </a><a href="bcapp_34.htm#1081594">Configure with the Portal Administrator Wizard</a>  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="1080790"> </a><a href="bcapp_35.htm#1070931">Try it!</a>  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="1080794"> </a><a href="bcapp_36.htm#1070940">How it works</a></ul>  </body></html>
