A portal is defined by a Web server virtual directory and provides access to one and only one site. Two or more portals can, however, provide access to the same site. This is most typically done on different Web servers so that clustering can be used to provide increased system performance for a high number of concurrent users. The definition of each portal and which site it accesses are defined and saved in the file system of the machine running the Subscription Portal Web server.</p><h4 class="Heading3">  <a name="1070319"> </a>Deleting a Subscription Portal</h4><p class="Body">  <a name="1070327"> </a>Deleting a portal means the site is no longer accessible through that virtual directory. It does nothing to the site definition or properties that were configured through the site. However, the site can become available for viewing through another portal, once that Subscription Portal is configured to point to the site definition.</p>  </body></html>
