<h1>Subscription Engine</h1>
<p>During a typical installation the Subscription Engine is installed on the same machine as the Portal Administrator Wizard and the Subscription Portal application. This machine is the <strong>localhost</strong>, unless you have chosen to install the Subscription Engine on a different machine.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Subscription Engine services should run automatically when the machine starts. If the Subscription Engine services do not start automatically, you must manually start the six components of the Subscription Engine. These are JDataConnect, MicroStrategy Subscription Administrator, MicroStrategy Subscription Engine, MicroStrategy Subscription Logger, MicroStrategy Subscription Lookup, and MicroStrategy Subscription Server. For information about these components and how to start them, see Subscription Portal subsystem in chapter 3, Configuring Machines, in the <em>MicroStrategy Narrowcast Server System Administrator Guide</em>.</p>
