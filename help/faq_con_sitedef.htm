This name and description are only seen by the Portal Administrator.  Each site definition should have a unique name so the Administrator knows at a glance which properties are contained within the definition.</p><a name="objrep"><h2>Object Repository</h2></a><p>For more information on the Object Repository, refer to <a href="faq_con_dbconnection.html" target="help">Database Connections</a>.</p><a name="sbr"><h2>Subscription Book Repository</h2></a><p>For more information on the Subscription Book Repository, refer to <a href="faq_con_dbconnection.html" target="help">Database Connections</a>.</p><a name="channels"><h2>Channels</h2></a><p>A channel is a visual representation within the Subscription Portal of the service offerings available to the end users.  The end users navigate through the channel folders and select the services to which they wish to subscribe.  </p><a name="devicetypes"><h2>Device Types</h2></a><p>A device refers to an administration object used to represent a message-receiving technology employed by end users. The device type is how that information is received by the end user.  For example, an Outlook 98 Device might specify that the first document in  the publication must be plain text and no longer than 128 characters. It might also specify that the second document could be either plain text or HTML, and if it is HTML then image references can be embedded. </p><p>Narrowcast Server Subscription Portal supports four types of devices:</p><ul><li>Mobile phone<li>Pager<li>E-mail<li>Personal Digital Assistants</ul><p>If you do not want to support these four device types, such as you only want your subscribers to receive information via e-mail, you may delete devices within the site definition.  You can alsocreate new device types.  These devices must be supported within the Narrowcast Server environment. </p> <a name="portal"><h2>Portal Devices</h2></a><p>The portal device is a specific way of delivering content to the end user.  The defaults provided should not be changed unless there is a specific need.  The <b>Portal device</b> has been selected as Web Device (Portal). This setting is preconfigured for a Web browser so the My Reports page is displayed properly.  If it is changed, for example, to an e-mail client, the end user does not receive a proper report.</p><a name="ISM"><h2>Information Sources</h2></a><p>Each Subscription Portal supports a set of information sources. These information sources determine the level of authentication necessary to access certain information in the Object Repository. When a new user is created through the Subscription Portal, the system prompts for information based on the properties specified in the site definition.  </p><h3>Use Project Credentials</h3><p>Selecting the <b>Use Project Credentials</b> prompt, the Administrator prompts for information based on the default login settings within Narrowcast Server.</p><h3>Use User Credentials (Required)</h3><p>Selecting this option requires the user to provide authentication information each time he logs on to the service.</p><h3>Use User Credentials (Option)</h3><p>Selecting this option requires the user to provide authentication information as necessary, when he logs on to the service.</p><a name="preferences"><h2>Preferences</h2></a><p>The <b>Preferences</b> section controls how the default values are set for users of the Subscription Portal interface.</p><h3>Project Settings</h3><p>This section manages new user properties.</p><table cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" border="1"><tr>    <td>Enable creation of new users</td>    <td><ul><li>Options: Yes or No	<li>Default is <b>Yes</b></li></ul></td></tr><tr>    <td>Default new users locale:</td>    <td><ul><li>Options: System or ???	<li>Default is <b>System</b></li></ul></td></tr><tr>    <td>New users expiration</td>    <td><ul><li>Options: No expiration (default) 	<li>Set a date	<li>After a certain number of days</li></ul></td></tr></table><h3>Interface Settings</h3><p>This section manages the Subscription Portal interface.</p><table cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" border="1"><tr>    <td>Default use DHTML:</td>    <td><ul><li>Options: 	<li>Default: Determine Automatically </li></ul></td></tr><tr>    <td>Cache Storage Mechanism</td>    <td><ul><li>Options: Session Variables	<li> Temp files directory	<li>Default: Session Variables</li></ul></td></tr></table><h3>Administrator Information</h3>This section allows you to enter the technical contact information for the Portal Administrator or technical support team member.</font></body></html>
